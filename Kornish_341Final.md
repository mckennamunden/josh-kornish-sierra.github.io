#Overview of Site and Influences

##For my final project in Web Development 341 I wanted to create a portfolio website that represents my work as a designer.  I curated the content for a general audience as I’m not necessarily looking for freelance work at this time and felt that B2B details would be better left to private inquiries via the contact section.  The overall aesthetic of the site construction was chosen from a short list of free Bootsraps templates based on it’s simple, clean navigation and interactive features.
##Major design changes to the template involved gutting a few miscellaneous sections and changing the color scheme to black and white.  I spent the most time working on the top fold of the site to make it clean and quickly communicable.  
##My style and philosophy as a designer has largely been influenced by artists Jimmy Chin and Jeff Shapiro, and I studied both of their sites (jimmychin.com & searchingforsatori.com) for aesthetic inspiration. My work is always in flux so I chose to complete the design section with links to each of my social media platforms where I engage the most and have the ability to interact with potential clients.  I chose to reflect my minimalist approach in the design section of the site by summing up my design philosophy in one quote:

###“A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.” –Lao Tzu

#Process

##I built the two-page website utilizing the Bootstrap framework for the main landing page and Google Blueprint for the gallery section of the site.  I began work on the final rendition of my site by downloading the “Greyscale” Bootstrap CDN and editing the content, leaving the interactive scripts alone.  The contact form at the bottom was imported in from Formspree but was challenging to make functional.  With your help it works great and psyched to have the feature set up on the site.
##Editing the provided templates and components taught me an incredible amount about code structure and towards the end I was creating new sections of my website by hand.  One issue I had early on in the project was making my CSS changes functional.  I realized that only the .min version of the Bootstrap was affecting my HTML page, yet the .min was impossible to read.  To solve this I used the Atom “beautify” tool which make the code legible and I was then able to edit photos andcolors.  My proudest success was fixing the ‘contact section’ by handing in a new CSS class.

#Conclusions & Future Work

##I feel that people who go to my site will be able to quickly understand that I am a soft-goods designer who creates climbing gear.  This is my focus at this stage in my life and overall I feel happy with my final project.  Web Development is a continuous work in progress and I may very well continue with this project.  Coding is still magic to me and I have mad respect for proficient coders; I will like hosting on github.io is hip and I’d put love to put the web address on a business card.  
##Future changes to the site will involve a lot of content creation as I hone my business model and look towards potentially doing free-lance work.  At this point free-lance work doesn’t interest me but in the future I hope to create a soft-goods design studio and may very build the site off this template.  Something that I would change if I could would be the photos as they cropped poorly and most of mine didn’t work.  I largely chose photos that worked with the text but I’d create more purposeful, thought-out banners for future renditions.
