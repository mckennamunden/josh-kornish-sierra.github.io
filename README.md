#Final Project - Personal Portfolio

##For my final project in Web Development 341 I built a personal portfolio website utilizing the Bootstrap Framework. The site is meant to be minimal by design and provide my audience with a taste of my construction style and design aesthetic.  The portfolio section of the site is built with Google Blueprint which automatically styles my images and requires little effort to maintain. I changed the color palettes of both pages to be black and white by editing the CSS code that came with the individual CDNs.  

##For the Contact section of the site I used a formspree component to perform the email relay, which functions via the github hosting.  

##All images are my own of me, used with permission.  Image selection for the main page ultimately came down to what worked best within the Bootstrap template.
